# Internet of Models (IoM) OS - Product Requirements Document

Create a developer-focused platform that enables seamless model-to-model communication and composition through a visual interface and robust API layer.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Professional** - Clean, technical interface that prioritizes functionality and data visibility for developers
2. **Intuitive** - Complex model orchestration made accessible through visual pipeline building and clear feedback
3. **Reliable** - Robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and transparent system health monitoring

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, accounts)
- Requires sophisticated state management for model registry, pipeline execution, real-time monitoring, and user authentication across multiple interconnected systems.

## Essential Features

### Model Registration System
- **Functionality**: Register models with metadata including endpoints, schemas, performance metrics, and security policies
- **Purpose**: Create a discoverable catalog of available AI models and services
- **Trigger**: User clicks "Register Model" or submits via REST API
- **Progression**: Form input → schema validation → unique ID generation → registry storage → confirmation
- **Success criteria**: Model appears in registry with all metadata, accessible via API and UI

### Service Discovery Engine
- **Functionality**: Search and filter models by capabilities, input types, latency, cost, and availability
- **Purpose**: Enable dynamic model selection based on requirements and constraints
- **Trigger**: Search query or API call with filter parameters
- **Progression**: Query input → filter application → ranking algorithm → results display → model selection
- **Success criteria**: Relevant models returned within 200ms, accurate filtering and sorting

### Dynamic Pipeline Orchestration
- **Functionality**: Execute model chains with automatic routing, retry logic, and fallback support
- **Purpose**: Enable complex AI workflows without manual integration coding
- **Trigger**: Pipeline execution request via UI or API
- **Progression**: Task analysis → model selection → chain execution → result aggregation → output delivery
- **Success criteria**: Pipeline completes with proper data flow, error handling, and performance logging

### Visual Pipeline Builder
- **Functionality**: Drag-and-drop interface for composing model workflows with real-time validation
- **Purpose**: Make model composition accessible to non-technical users while maintaining developer control
- **Trigger**: User accesses pipeline builder interface
- **Progression**: Model selection → drag to canvas → connect nodes → configure parameters → validate → save/execute
- **Success criteria**: Complex pipelines can be built visually and execute identically to API-driven workflows

### Model Invocation Interface
- **Functionality**: Test models individually with input/output inspection and performance metrics
- **Purpose**: Enable rapid model testing and debugging before integration
- **Trigger**: "Test" button on model or pipeline
- **Progression**: Input specification → validation → execution → result display → metrics logging
- **Success criteria**: Real-time feedback with latency, token usage, and success/error states

## Edge Case Handling
- **Model Unavailability**: Automatic failover to backup models or graceful degradation
- **Schema Mismatch**: Clear validation errors with suggested fixes and data transformation options  
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent queuing and backoff strategies with user notification
- **Authentication Failures**: Secure key management with clear permission error messages
- **Network Timeouts**: Configurable timeout handling with retry logic and fallback options
- **Invalid Pipeline Configurations**: Real-time validation with visual error indicators

## Design Direction
The design should feel like a professional developer tool - clean, data-dense, and highly functional with subtle technical aesthetics that inspire confidence in the system's reliability and precision.

## Color Selection
Triadic color scheme using deep technical blues, warm amber alerts, and clean grays to create a professional developer environment that clearly communicates system states and hierarchical information.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Technical Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - Communicates reliability and technical precision for primary actions and branding
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral Gray (oklch(0.65 0.05 240)) for backgrounds and subtle UI elements, Dark Charcoal (oklch(0.25 0.02 240)) for text and borders
- **Accent Color**: Warm Amber (oklch(0.75 0.15 65)) - Attention-grabbing highlight for warnings, active states, and critical status indicators
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Light Gray oklch(0.98 0.01 240)): Dark Charcoal text (oklch(0.25 0.02 240)) - Ratio 14.2:1 ✓
  - Card (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Charcoal text (oklch(0.25 0.02 240)) - Ratio 16.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.45 0.15 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.1:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Neutral Gray oklch(0.65 0.05 240)): Dark Charcoal text (oklch(0.25 0.02 240)) - Ratio 6.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm Amber oklch(0.75 0.15 65)): Dark Charcoal text (oklch(0.25 0.02 240)) - Ratio 7.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Use JetBrains Mono for code/technical content and Inter for UI text to create a developer-focused environment that balances technical precision with excellent readability.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Component Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body Text: Inter Regular/14px/relaxed line height
  - Code/Technical: JetBrains Mono Regular/13px/monospace precision
  - Captions/Metadata: Inter Regular/12px/muted color

## Animations
Subtle, functional animations that provide immediate feedback for technical workflows while maintaining the professional feel - primarily focused on state transitions, loading indicators, and data flow visualization rather than decorative effects.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates system state changes, data processing flow, and provides confidence through smooth transitions that mirror the underlying technical processes
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Pipeline execution gets primary animation focus, followed by model status updates, then UI state changes

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Cards for model registry items, Dialogs for model registration forms, Tabs for different views (registry/builder/analytics), Tables for model listings with sorting, Progress indicators for pipeline execution, Badges for model status and types
- **Customizations**: Custom pipeline canvas component using React Flow, specialized model node components with technical metadata display, custom metrics dashboard using recharts
- **States**: Models have online/offline/error states with distinct visual indicators, Buttons show loading states during model invocation, Form inputs provide real-time schema validation feedback
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons - Cpu for compute models, Eye for vision models, ChatCircle for language models, GitBranch for pipelines, Play for execution, Settings for configuration
- **Spacing**: Consistent 16px grid system with 8px micro-spacing for tight technical layouts, 24px between major sections, 32px page margins
- **Mobile**: Stack pipeline builder vertically on mobile, collapse model metadata into expandable sections, maintain full functionality with touch-optimized controls for developer use cases
